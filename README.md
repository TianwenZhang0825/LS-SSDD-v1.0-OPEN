This is a Large-Scale SAR Ship Detection Dataset-v1.0 (LS-SSDD-v1.0) from Sentinel-1, for small ship detection under large-scale backgrounds. LS-SSDD-v1.0 contains 15 large-scale SAR images whose ground truths are correctly labeled by SAR experts by drawing support from Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Google Earth. To facilitate network training, the large-scale images are directly cut into 9,000 sub-images without bells and whistles, providing convenience for subsequent detection result presentation in large-scale SAR images.
